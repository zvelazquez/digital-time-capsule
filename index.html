                    Zanett has a wide variety of hobbies that she enjoys doing when she can find some free time (which is rare). From a young age, art has always been a passion of hers. She not only enjoys viewing and learning about it, but creating it as well. Her favorite mediums to work with include charcoal, gouache, pen+ink, and acrylics. Aside from art, her other hobbies also provide opportunities for creative outlet. These include photography, crochet, embroidery, listening to music, playing guitar, traveling, and spending time with friends and family.

                    It was this love of art that influenced her choice to pursue a career in design. As a highly visual learner, she understands the value of effective communication and visual cues. As a designer, she hopes to be able to help communicate ideas, thoughts, information, and feelings in compelling and memorable ways. Her past experience in design includes serving as Art Director on the Editorial Team of her high school's yearbook staff, as well as completing a semester-long design internship with a local designer. Zanett has also completed a wide variety of freelance work as a designer, from event banners to film posters, and business logos.</p>
