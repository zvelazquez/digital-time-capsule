# digital-time-capsule
Designed and created by Zanett Velazquez

# project overview
For this project, I created a multi-page website detailing and preserving my digital interactions with different websites and services. Serving as a sort of “time capsule”, this website features three separate pages highlighting my current likes and usage data with certain apps and sites. This project also served as a practice in building up my skills in HTML and CSS coding to create a visually cohesive and functional site, as well as learning the process of producing a shareable link to access my site from an external server by means of creating a repository for my code on GitHub.
