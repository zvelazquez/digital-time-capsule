# digital-time-capsule
Designed and created by Zanett Velazquez


# project overview
For this project, I created a multi-page website detailing and preserving my digital interactions with different websites and services. Serving as a sort of “time capsule”, this website features three separate pages highlighting my current likes and usage data with certain apps and sites. This project also served as a practice in building up my skills in HTML and CSS coding to create a visually cohesive and functional site, as well as learning the process of producing a shareable link to access my site from an external server by means of creating a repository for my code on GitHub.


# technical overview
CURRENT STATUS = Complete 100%

To create this site, I used the Visual Studio Code application to create my HTML and CSS code for the site. 

Since it is a multi-page site, there are three separate HTML files, with each having its own corresponding CSS file.

Web-safe fonts derived from Google Fonts including: Handjet, Gruppo, and Jost 

I incorporated the use of flex-box {} in order to have better control over the layout of the design.

I wanted my site to feature a sticky navigation bar so that it would be easier to navigate to other pages no matter how far you scroll down on the page. I felt that this was an important feature to add in order to make navigating the site more efficient and accessible.

For the navigation bar, I also include three separate states for the links, including an active state, hover state, and default state. This would help the user to correctly and quickly identify what page they were on, and allow them to visually select which page they would navigate to next. For the transition from one state to another, I incorporated a timed transition so the change was not instantaneous. I felt that this was important to ease the jump from one state to another.
